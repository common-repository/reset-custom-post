Reset Custom Post is a WordPress plugin that provides an easy solution for managing unwanted custom post content.

== Description ==
üßπ After testing and adding test content to your site, do you want to clean it up quickly and efficiently before going into production? The Reset Custom Post plugin is the solution! Unlike other plugins that delete all the content on your site, my plugin lets you select precisely what you want to clean up while preserving important pages or other content.

üí° With Reset Custom Post, you can easily select the type of content you want to clean up, and even delete associated images with a single click. What's more, I've added a new feature that lets you remove items from the taxonomies available for the selected custom content type. üóëÔ∏è The cleanup process is transparent and tracked via a detailed log window, guaranteeing an optimal user experience.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `reset-custom-post` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to the `Reset CPT` menu in the WordPress admin dashboard `Tools` to access the plugin settings.
